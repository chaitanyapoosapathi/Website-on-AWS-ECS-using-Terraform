- I have used terraform for infrastructure provisioning in this project
- The application can be reached from https://northone.chaits.ca
- Please use username "northone" and password "northone" which connects to the user i have already created for you, user info is backed on postgres DB
- Scales both on task level and instance level
- I have also created a docker-compose file for local development
- This project creates load balancer and auto scaling with rds backend 
- Uses ECS for hosting docker containers
